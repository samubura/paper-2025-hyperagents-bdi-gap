\section{Introduction}
%==========================================================

Integrating intelligent agents with the Web is a long-standing goal
in both the \ac{MAS}~\cite{DBLP:conf/edoc/ShafiqDF06}
and Semantic Web~\cite{lassila2001semantic} communities, but,
despite such common interest, 
the famous question 
``Where are all the intelligent agents?''
remains unanswered to this day~\cite{hendlerb2007expert}:
the Web is still dominated by traditional clients, servers, 
and (most recently) bots and scrapers%
---which can hardly be considered full agents.
%
However,
as recent developments in Web engineering have led to 
the more pervasive adoption of the \ac{REST} architectural style~\cite{DBLP:journals/toit/FieldingT02},
and the growing adoption of Web interoperability standards % even outside the traditional Web domain
-- for instance with the \ac{WoT}~\cite{wotarch} --
the integration of \ac{MAS} and the Web gained new momentum.

Along this line, 
the \ac{W3C} Autonomous Agents on the Web community group\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/}}
has been founded to connect researchers and practitioners
and a new perspective has been proposed: \ac{hMAS}~\cite{DBLP:conf/atal/CiorteaMGBRZ19}
envision the (Semantic) Web as an open environment in which
agents can interact by consuming and manipulating hypermedia resources.

Even more recently, 
with the advent of \ac{LLM}-based \emph{Agentic AI}~\cite{acharya2025access} 
the creation of \ac{LLM}-driven agents that interact with Web APIs~\missingref{}
-- or directly with Websites~\cite{10.5555/3692070.3694608} --
has gained significant attention.
%
However,
despite being promising,
these approaches
do not make structured knowledge representation obsolete~\cite{pan2024tkde}, 
and often sacrifice the controllability of traditional agent-programming paradigms~\missingref{}
%to sell the (hollow?) promise of circumventing the need for structured knowledge representation and reasoning~\cite{pan2024tkde}%
at the price of relaxed guarantees in terms of correctness, and completeness.
% provided by Semantic Web technologies such as the \ac{RDF}~\cite{RDF_Concepts_W3C:14} and \ac{OWL}~\cite{OWL_Syntax_W3C:12}.

Arguably,
agents developed with cognitive architectures 
%-- yet symbolic --,
such as \ac{BDI} agents,
would retain controllability and predictability,
if only they could be effectively integrated with the Web:
they could directly exploit hypermedia to discover new resources and actions, 
and use Semantic Web technologies like \ac{RDF}~\cite{RDF_Concepts_W3C:14} and \ac{OWL}~\cite{OWL_Syntax_W3C:12} 
to act intelligently without sacrificing quality.
%
However,
we believe
the integration of \ac{BDI} agents with the Web
is hindered by a conceptual and technological gap, 
which limits developers in creating agents that need to interact with (Semantic) hypermedia.
%
More precisely:
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\textbf{(G\arabic*)}]
  \item\label{gap:logic}
  \ac{BDI} agents are historically tied to \ac{LP}
  %-- e.g., with the popular \agentspeak{} semantic~\cite{DBLP:conf/maamaw/Rao96} --
  whereas the Semantic Web is grounded on \ac{DL},
  and the two paradigms are theoretically compatible, 
  but technologically backed by poorly interoperable technologies,
  increasing the burden of developers wishing to integrate them;
  % The different technological choices used to concretely implement them add cognitive load to developers working on the integration of the two worlds (e.g., converting \ac{OWL} and \ac{RDF} triples in Prolog-like formulas);
  
  \item\label{gap:open-world}
  \ac{BDI} agents are typically implemented with the \ac{PRS} architecture~\cite{georgeff1986pieee} 
  which relies on pre-defined plans and does not natively support discovering new actions at runtime,
  by interacting with the hypermedia environment.
\end{enumerate*}

In this paper, 
we reflect on these gaps,
their technical implications, % on the overall development experience of creating \ac{BDI} agents that interact with Web resources 
and
how they can be mitigated by abstracting the design of agent-oriented programming languages and frameworks. 
%
We start by providing a brief overview of the \ac{BDI} model, 
the hypermedia nature of the (Semantic) Web,
and 
the fundamental principles of \ac{hMAS} in \Cref{sec:background}.
%
We then analyze the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia, 
and identify ideal integration requirements in \Cref{sec:gap-analysis}
%
Then, 
in \Cref{sec:related-works},
we test those requirements against prior contributions 
which already attempted to bridge the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and semantic hypermedia.
%
Finally, 
in \Cref{sec:generalized-bdi-engine},
we present our research direction
aimed at %tightening the integration of \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia
reducing the abstraction gap for developers
by introducing a generalized \ac{BDI} engine
that can directly leverage Semantic Web technologies for belief representation and deliberation;
and we discuss open challenges and opportunities of our approach.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
%==========================================================

\subsection{BDI Agents}
\gcsidenote{Se serve racimolare spazio, io questa la toglierei}

The \ac{BDI} model~\cite{DBLP:conf/atal/GeorgeffPPTW98}
is a well-established cognitive architecture for the development of intelligent agents.
%
% It is based on the idea of representing an agent's mental state in terms of three key components:
% \begin{inlinelist}
%   \item \emph{beliefs} are what the agent thinks to be true,
%   \item \emph{desires} are the potential goals or objectives an agent may pursue,
%   \item \emph{intentions} are the agent's commitments to achieve specific desires.
% \end{inlinelist}
\ac{BDI} agents follow a continuous cycle of
\begin{inlinelist}
  \item \emph{perception} of external stimuli and gather new \emph{beliefs},
  \item \emph{deliberation} to update beliefs, goals and choose \emph{intentions} to pursue selecting \emph{plan} to achieve goals,
  and
  \item \emph{action} advancing one intention by executing a step of the associated plan.
\end{inlinelist}
Practically, most \ac{BDI} agents implementations follow the \ac{PRS} architecture~\cite{georgeff1986pieee},
which is based on the ability for agents to select plans from a predefined set
and execute them to achieve their goals.

To declaratively define the agent's behavior the \ac{AOP} community has developed several \ac{BDI} programming languages and frameworks~\cite{DBLP:conf/woa/MascardiDA05}.
%
Arguably, the most popular language is \agentspeak{}~\cite{DBLP:conf/maamaw/Rao96} which 
uses a formal syntax and semantics derived from \ac{LP} for representing beliefs, goals and actions using logic predicates.
%This allows to exploit logic unification to query the agent's \emph{belief base} and match plans to achieve goals.
%The \agentspeak{} abstract language has been implemented in the \jason{}~\cite{bordini2007programming} agent programming platform, providing an interpreter and a Java-based runtime environment for developing \ac{BDI} \ac{MAS}.

% The logic-based nature of \agentspeak{} has characterized the development of \ac{BDI} agents due to its expressiveness and flexibility in supporting the basic mechanisms of the \ac{BDI} reasoning cycle.
%
Despite \ac{BDI} programming languages and frameworks have also been implemented without such a strong reliance on \ac{LP} mechanisms (e.g., \cite{map2005sp,kampik2019emas}), in the following when we refer to \ac{BDI} agents we will implicitly refer to \agentspeak{}-like agents.

\subsection{The Web, Semantics and Hypermedia}

The World Wide Web was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee as a global, open information space
based on the ability to link resources through hypermedia documents~\cite{DBLP:journals/cn/Berners-LeeCG92}.
%
The Web is built with the \ac{REST} architectural style~\cite{DBLP:journals/toit/FieldingT02}
which supports independently evolving components through a set of principles.
%
% The \ac{REST} architectural style~\cite{DBLP:journals/toit/FieldingT02}
% adopted by the Web allows to have independently evolving components
% that can interact through a uniform interface thanks to:
% \begin{inlinelist}
%   \item \acp{URI} to identify resources,
%   \item the exchange of representations of resources using shared data formats (e.g., JSON, XML),
%   \item self-descriptive messages following the semantics of the HTTP protocol, and
%   \item the use of \ac{HATEOAS} guiding clients in their next possible actions.
% \end{inlinelist}

The Semantic Web~\cite{BernersLee2001} complements the \emph{self-descriptive} principle of \ac{REST} 
by encoding semantics in the representation through the general model of \ac{RDF}~\cite{RDF_Concepts_W3C:14}
based on machine-readable \emph{triples}
that state facts using a common vocabulary defined within ontologies.
%
{OWL}~\cite{OWL_Syntax_W3C:12} allows the encoding of such ontologies following the principles of \ac{DL} to define concepts and relationships between them.
%
%Ontologies can be used to encode structured knowledge about a domain of interest, creating consensus on the meaning of concepts and relationships between them, hence improving interoperability between different systems on the open Web.

Another fundamental principle is \ac{HATEOAS} which defines hypermedia as ``the simultaneous presentation of information and controls such that the information becomes the affordance through which the user obtains choices and selects actions''~\cite{DBLP:journals/toit/FieldingT02}.
% %
% Affordances
% -- i.e., action possibilities --
% are central to the inner workings of the Web,
% allowing clients to discover new resources and actions by consuming hypermedia.
% This mechanism drives the state transitions of the distributed client-server system
% ensuring scalability and independence of individual components.
In this way, the Web can be seen as an open environment
where clients discover new resources and action possibilities by consuming hypermedia.
%
When such hypermedia is annotated with explicit semantics it should be possible for clients to better understand the meaning of the affordances, avoiding the need for hard-coded knowledge.
%
%This is the mechanism adopted for instance in the \ac{WoT}~\cite{wotarch} where \emph{\ac{TD}} are used as semantic hypermedia representations of \ac{IoT} devices,
%declaring the possible interaction affordances exposed by the devices (e.g., reading a sensor value, turning on a light, etc.).


\subsection{Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems}

The idea of \ac{hMAS}~\cite{DBLP:conf/atal/CiorteaMGBRZ19} seeks a deeper integration of \ac{MAS} and the Web through the adoption of hypermedia and \ac{REST} principles.
%
The main idea behind such integration is to overcome the limitations of previous approaches to \ac{MAS} and Web integration, by considering the Web as an \emph{environment} for agents to operate in~\cite{ciortea2018emas}.
%
Following the idea of the environment as a first-class abstraction of \ac{MAS}~\cite{weyns2007aamas},
\ac{hMAS} revisits the Agents and Artifacts meta-model~\cite{ricci2011aamas} as a way to modularize and program the environment.
%
In \ac{hMAS}, artifacts are represented as hypermedia resources, exposing affordances that agents can discover through the uniform interface of the Web.

Most of the effort in the \ac{hMAS} community has been focused on shaping the environment dimension of the \ac{MAS}, as ideally heterogeneous agents should be able to operate in the same environment.
%
However, the agent dimension of \ac{hMAS} must also be investigated to improve how agents can effectively exploit the hypermedia environment (e.g., for action discovery at runtime~\cite{vachtsevanou2024atal}).
%
In this paper, we focus on such agent dimension of \ac{hMAS} and specifically on \ac{BDI} agents and how to support deeper integration with semantic hypermedia.

%==========================================================
\section{Integrating \acs{BDI} Agents and Semantic Hypermedia: a Gap Analysis}
\label{sec:gap-analysis}
%==========================================================

% From the brief background presented in \Cref{sec:background}, 
% it should be evident that
% despite both \ac{BDI} agents and the Semantic Web being rooted in logic-based knowledge representation,
% there are significant differences between the two worlds.
% %Specifically, Prolog-like logic typically used to practically implement \ac{BDI} agents and \ac{DL} used in the Semantic Web are different subsets of \ac{FOL} with consequently different expressiveness and semantics
% Specifically, \ac{DL} excel in representing relationships between concepts, while \ac{BDI} agents use \ac{LP} to store facts about the external environment as belief and declaratively express goals.
% The different technologies used in the two different paradigms makes them difficult to integrate \ref{gap:logic}.
% %
% Furthermore, \ac{BDI} agents are typically designed with a closed-world perspective whereas the Semantic Web is an open information space \ref{gap:open-world}.
% %
% When it comes to practical applications this creates an abstraction and technological gap
% which can be difficult to bridge for developers.
% %
% In the following, we describe in more detail such differences.

Here we delve into the details of the gaps that we identified between \ac{BDI} agents and semantic hypermedia,
namely,
\ref{gap:logic} the practical differences for knowledge representation and manipulation 
between \ac{LP} and Semantic Web technologies,
and 
\ref{gap:open-world} the limitations of \ac{BDI} agents with \emph{open} hypermedia environments,
where actions are not predefined but discovered at runtime.

\paragraph{Syntactical Differences Between \acs{LP} and \acs{RDF}.}

On a syntactical level, 
\ac{BDI} agents commonly represent beliefs as definite clauses\missingref{} %,
% and goals as facts
%which are either atomic \emph{terms} (e.g., \texttt{alice}) or a \emph{structure} composed of a \emph{functor} followed by an arbitrary number of \emph{arguments} within parentheses
(e.g. \texttt{person(alice)}).
%
In the Semantic Web, 
knowledge is represented in the form of \ac{RDF} \emph{triples} which connect a \emph{subject} to an \emph{object} through a \emph{predicate} (e.g. \texttt{:alice rdf:type foaf:Person}).
%
Although \ac{RDF} triples can be represented as definite clauses 
(while the opposite is not true), 
in practice,
semantic knowledge is available on the Web in \ac{RDF},
and accessing that from \ac{BDI} agents requires a translation step,
which has many degrees of freedom
(e.g., \texttt{type(alice, person)} and \texttt{triple(alice, type, person)} are reasonable mappings of the \ac{RDF} triple above),
and it is up to \ac{BDI} developers.
%
% Developers wishing to integrate \ac{BDI} agents with the Semantic Web hence face the challenges of choosing a suitable -- and more importantly consistent -- mapping which we believe adds a significant cognitive load during the development process.
In other words,
implementing the translation is additional work which, if handled manually in an ad-hoc manner can be source of inconsistencies.

\paragraph{Ontological Reasoning}

\ac{RDF} triplets are commonly paired with \ac{OWL} ontologies (e.g., \texttt{foaf}\footnote{\url{http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/}} in the example above),
providing \emph{axioms} that define the meaning of the triples's predicates 
(e.g., \texttt{rdf:type} denotes the \emph{instance of} relation between subjects and classes),
as well as constraints, and relationships between concepts.
%
This is a way to standardize knowledge representation across hypermedia.
%
Logic programs, instead, are not really meant to be scattered over the Web,
nor being accessed remotely.

Again,
there is a hidden trap for \ac{BDI} developers willing to create agents that can perform ontological reasoning:
% This means that, in order to properly reason about the knowledge represented in \ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL},
% developers may need to translate the whole \ac{RDF}, \ac{OWL} and ontology semantics into their own belief base, adding a significant overhead and a potential source of inconsistencies. 
either they translate the \ac{OWL} ontology into definite clauses,
or they wrap some \ac{OWL} reasoner into the agent interpreter and reasoning cycle.
%
Despite being automatable to some extent (cf. ~\cite{samuel2008tplp}),
both activities require additional engineering effort,
and should rather be addressed with direct support from the \ac{BDI} framework.

% Although \ac{OWL} ontologies can be converted into logic formulas through an automatic process
% it can be cumbersome for \ac{BDI} developers to exploit them when writing the agent program
% and similarly hard for Semantic Web experts to understand how to properly interact with the translated knowledge base.

\paragraph{Querying and Inference.}

\ac{BDI} commonly relies on \ac{SLD} resolution~\cite{emden1976jacm} to query the belief base,
when this is implemented as a logic program.
%
Furthermore,
they rely on logic unification~\cite{10.1145/357162.357169} to match plans and goals,
making the intertwining with \ac{LP} even deeper.
%
% This basic mechanism allows to easily verify conditions based on the current beliefs, retrieve information and also perform inference using dedicated rules developers can encode to represent the problem domain.
% %
% Unification relies on finding a substitution for the variables in a logic formula that makes it true with the facts within a logic theory. When multiple substitutions are possible, the unification process usually returns the first available one, as it is typically implemented as a depth-first search algorithm with backtracking.
%
Conversely, 
the Semantic Web relies on \acs{SPARQL}~\cite{sparqlprotocol} to query \ac{RDF} data.
%
\acs{SPARQL} allows matching graph patterns and retrieve all the values of variables in the pattern from the matched triples, 
providing an intuitive way to query the knowledge base.

Despite both \acs{LP} and \acs{SPARQL} allow expressing declarative queries for a knowledge base,
the latter may be more practical and efficient for \ac{RDF} data,
especially when the query spans over multiple triples.
%
Consider for instance a query searching for the unknown relations \texttt{?r} between \texttt{alice} and \texttt{bob},
and matching all the triples where the subject is \texttt{carl} and
the predicate is \texttt{?r} to retrieve all the objects \texttt{?x}.
%
A query on this kind would be straightforward to write in \acs{SPARQL},
while requiring second-order variables in \ac{LP}%
---a feature which is not commonly supported by \ac{LP} or \ac{BDI} frameworks,
and which is commonly worked around via \emph{meta-programming},
resulting in longer and cumbersome \ac{LP} code.

%
As for inference, 
given the expressiveness limitations of \ac{OWL}, 
\ac{SWRL}~\cite{horrocks2004swrl} can be used to define inference rules.
%
% An important difference is that while logic unification automatically performs inference, \acs{SPARQL} searches only on the set of triples currently in a knowledge base. If inference is required, the developer must explicitly \emph{materialize} the triples inferred by a reasoner before querying.
Here, a similar argument like the one above concerning the wrapping of \ac{SWRL} reasoners applies.

\paragraph{Open vs. Close Environments}

\ac{BDI} agents are equipped with a predefined set of plans, composed of sequences of actions that the agent knows how to execute.
%
Additionally, \ac{BDI} agents usually run in a closed environment,
which is designed by the developer to provide perceptions to the agents and 
support the execution of the actions used in the plans~\cite{weyns2007aamas}. 
%
The development process of \ac{BDI} agents is hence based on the fact that a developer anticipates 
the relevant possible settings an agent may encounter and provides plans to handle them.
%
This makes it difficult for agents to adapt to unexpected settings or to flexibly incorporate new actions that become available while exploring the environment.
%
Relating this to the open hypermedia nature of the Web, makes the effective integration of \ac{BDI} agents challenging.
%
Following the \ac{HATEOAS} principle, agents may discover new affordances
-- i.e., action possibilities --
while navigating through the hypermedia environment.
%
The inability to exploit such new affordances may limit the agent in adapting to the environment and effectively interact with it.

\subsection{Integration Requirements}
\label{sec:integrating-bdi-hypermedia}

Guided by the gap analysis
we identify a set of requirements that we believe may improve practical development of \ac{BDI} agents in Web environments.
We hence propose that a \ac{BDI} agent programming framework for \ac{hMAS} should support the following features:
\begin{enumerate*}[label={(R\arabic*)}]
  \item direct manipulation of \ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL} triples in the agent's belief base;
  \label{req:first}
  \item ontological reasoning and inference for plan selection;
  \label{req:second}
  \item support for querying the belief base using \acs{SPARQL} instead of logic unification;
  \label{req:third}
  \item ability to exploit affordances discovered in the environment to dynamically adapt the agent's plans.
  \label{req:fourth}
\end{enumerate*}

\paragraph{Semantic extensions of AgentSpeak}
In \cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05} authors propose an AgentSpeak extension named AgentSpeak-DL, 
where the belief base concepts are extended with the addition of \ac{DL}.
%
With the \ac{DL} extension, 
AgentSpeak-DL supports the definition of more structured objects and relationships between them, 
rather than only logic terms.
%
The semantics of AgentSpeak-DL demonstrates that agent-oriented programming can be extended for the development of Semantic Web applications, 
easing their adaptation to applications such as Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing.
%
In line with the requirements, 
authors highlight that changing the belief representation affects three operations of the whole AgentSpeak lifecycle, namely: the plan research, the query on the Belief Base, and the Belief Update.
\mbnote{This last paragraph can be removed, on sec. 5 i repeat the same fact again.}
%

In \cite{DBLP:conf/iat/HalacED11} authors claim that AgentSpeak-DL does not provide a complete solution for the integration of \ac{BDI} agents and Semantic Web technologies,
mainly because goals are only represented as events for procedural plans.
%
Therefore, 
they propose an extension of the semantics where the agents lifecycle is enriched with goal states,
using a belief representation based on \ac{DL}.

\paragraph{Integration of DL in BDI engines}
The semantic extension AgentSpeak-DL, proposed in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05}, serves as the foundation for JASDL~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08}.
%
In this work, the authors present an extension of the \jason{} \ac{BDI} engine, where key components are adapted to incorporate \ac{DL} semantics.
%
The latter is introduced through "semantically-enriched" literals, represented within the agent's belief base using first-order logic (FOL) notation.
%
The examples in \Cref{lst:jasdl-example} illustrate how \ac{RDF} triples are represented as predicates in the belief base of the agent.
%
This design allows for the use of \jason{}'s standard belief base selection mechanisms, while layering a reasoning engine capable of querying ontology instances on top.
%
Representing \ac{DL} in this manner offers the advantage of leveraging the full capabilities of the existing \jason{} engine.
%
Nevertheless, this integration strategy complicated the direct application of the operational semantics described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08}, and necessitated additional technical adaptations to achieve compatibility.
%
However, 
this hindered the direct integration of the operational semantics described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08} 
and called for engineering efforts to bridge the gap in integration.

Similarly, 
in \cite{DBLP:conf/www/CharpenayZLB22} authors propose Hypermedea: 
an extension of the \jacamo{}~\cite{BOISSIER2013747} \ac{BDI} programming framework
for interacting with \ac{WoT} environments.
%
The main differences with respect to JASDL include:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item Hypermedea does not specialise the \ac{BDI} engine, 
but rather exploits the \cartago{} artifact model to serve required capabilities, and
\item the \ac{RDF} triple is transformed into a belief logic predicate differently, as shown in \Cref{lst:hypermedea-example}.
\end{inlinelist} 
%
Four kind of artifacts are defined in this contribution: 
\begin{inlinelist}
  \item \textit{Linked Data Artifacts} to interact with \ac{RDF} triples,
  \item \textit{Ontology Artifacts} which bridge the gap between \ac{RDF} models and predicate representaitons,
  \item \textit{Thing Artifacts} which proxies the communication with Things in the environment (i.e. each Thing its own Thing Artifact to interact with it), and
  \item \textit{Planner Artifacts} which synthetize plans given a \textit{domain description} and a \textit{Problem Description}, using PDDL definitions and FF-X planner. 
\end{inlinelist}

\label{sec:generalized-bdi-engine}
%==========================================================

In this section,
we propose a new approach to bridge the identified gaps between \ac{BDI} agents and semantic hypermedia resources,
guided by the requirements identified in \Cref{sec:integrating-bdi-hypermedia}.
%
The approach addresses mainly the first gap \ref{gap:logic}, 
and we believe it represents a first step towards addressing the second gap \ref{gap:open-world} as future work,
particularly by enabling more expressive \ac{BDI} frameworks.
%
The core idea is to introduce a generalised \ac{BDI} engine that encapsulates agents reasoning cycle, 
while decoupling the representation of beliefs from the framework itself. 
%
This separation allows the reasoning mechanisms to be adapted according to the specific needs of the application domain.
%
In this way, beliefs---and, consequently, reasoning---can flexibly support different formats depending on the domain. 
%
A sufficiently generalised \ac{BDI} engine can operate over \ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL} triples, JSON, YAML, or any other structured representation of knowledge, treating them as first-class citizens within the framework. 
%
This design fulfills the first requirement (\ref{req:first}).

However,
as identified also in \cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05}, 
the \ac{BDI} reasoning cycle is affected by the syntax representation.
%
Specifically,
there are three main operations concerned:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item \emph{plan selection} is the process of selecting a plan to achieve a goal among the ones available, 
  which evaluation of applicability is strictly related on how beliefs are represented in the belief base;
  \item \emph{belief querying} is the process of retrieving information from the belief base;
  \item \emph{belief update} is the process of updating the belief base with new information.
\end{itemize}
%
In \ac{LP}-based frameworks where beliefs are represented as Prolog ground terms, 
the three operations are typically implemented exploiting logic mechanisms such as unification and inference.
%
But in other domains,
the three operations must be adapted to the specific representation of the beliefs.
%
The incarnation of these three operations is in the hands of the person who implementsa responsibility of the developer of the \ac{BDI} engine specialization,
which specifies how the generic \ac{BDI} engine should operate on the specific representation of the beliefs,
thus addressing \ref{req:second} and \ref{req:third}. 



The integration of \ac{BDI} \ac{MAS} with heterogeneous syntax representations 
can be performed with a layered architecture of the framework.
%
The layered architecture proposed is composed of: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Generalized \ac{BDI} reasoning model}: encapsulates the general mechanisms of a \ac{BDI} framework, including the agent's deliberation process and reasoning cycle, while remaining agnostic to the syntax and semantics of the underlying belief representation.
  %
  Key responsibilities of this layer include:
  \begin{inlinelist}
    \item maintains the intention stack updated;
    \item manages goals lifecycle;
    \item defines the lifecycle of the agent (i.e. when to perceive, deliberate and act); and
    \item defines the protocols for belief update, belief retrieval and plan selection.
  \end{inlinelist}
  \item \textbf{Concrete Specification Layer}: defines how the abstract operations specified by the generalised \ac{BDI} model are grounded in a specific belief representation. This layer acts as a semantic adapter between the generalised engine and the data, enabling the architecture to support a wide variety of syntax representations without modifying the core reasoning logic.
  \item \textbf{Application layer}: responsible for defining the concrete goals, plans, and interactions of the agent tailored to a specific environment or task.
\end{enumerate}

The main advantages of this isolation are: reuse of the same reasoning engine across multiple domains, and Better support for semantic web standards and open-world reasoning.
