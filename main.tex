  Traditional BDI agents,

  which typically rely on Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and OWL.
  This paper examines the gap between these paradigms and surveys existing integration efforts on a conceptual and technical level.
  Our proposal for a deeper integration relies on a generalized BDI engine to enable the development of BDI agents that can directly reason and operate on hypermedia resources.
  We reflect on the potential benefits and challenges of this approach and show preliminary results of a proof-of-concept implementation.

\section{Introduction}
%==========================================================

Integrating intelligent agents with the Web is a long-standing goal
in both the \ac{MAS}~\cite{DBLP:conf/edoc/ShafiqDF06}
and Semantic Web~\cite{lassila2001semantic} communities, but,
despite such common interest, 
the famous question ``Where are all the intelligent agents?'' remains unanswered to this day~\cite{hendlerb2007expert}.

In the last decade, developments in the engineering of Web services including
the more pervasive use of hypermedia and the \ac{REST} architectural style~\missingref[fielding]{},
and the growing adoption of Web interoperability standards even outside the traditional Web domain
-- such as the \ac{WoT}~\missingref[wotarch]{} --
has renewed the interest in the integration of \ac{MAS} and the Web.
%
In this context, 
the proposal of \ac{hMAS}~\missingref[ciortea]{} suggested a new perspective
envisioning the Web itself as an open environment
which agents can roam by consuming and manipulating hypermedia resources.
%
As an outcome of the resurgence of Web \ac{MAS},
the \ac{W3C} Autonomous Agents on the Web community group\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/}}
has been founded to connect researchers and practitioners working in the area. 

Even more recently, the advent of \ac{LLM} and the \emph{Agentic AI} movement~\cite{acharya2025access} 
have taken by storm the development of intelligent agents that interact with the Web by invoking Web APIs~\missingref{} and interpreting natural language content~\missingref{}.
%
Despite these approaches showing promising results,
they do not yet replace the controllability of traditional agent-programming paradigms~\missingref{},
nor they make obsolete the need for structured knowledge representation and reasoning provided by Semantic Web technologies~\cite{pan2024tkde}.
%
Agents developed with cognitive architectures such as the \ac{BDI} model
capable of leveraging structured knowledge within the Semantic Web 
hence remain a valid approach for the development of intelligent systems on the Web.

We argue that the integration of \ac{BDI} agents with the Web
is hindered by a conceptual and technological gap, 
which limits developers in creating agents that can effectively reason and operate on semantic hypermedia resources.
Namely:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\roman*)}]
  \item \ac{BDI} agents have typically been tied to logic programming with \ac{FOL} and unification -- e.g., with the popular \agentspeak{} semantic~\missingref[agentspeak]{} --
  whereas the Semantic Web is grounded on \ac{DL} and the mechanism of inference through the \ac{OWL} and \ac{RDF};
  \label{itm:gap-logic}
  \item \ac{BDI} agents are typically implemented with the \ac{PRS} architecture~\missingref{} which relies on pre-defined plans and hence provides limited support for the exploitation of new action possibilities discovered in an open hypermedia environment.\sbsidenote{Decidiamo se sto secondo punto lo esploriamo per completezza o se vogliamo cavarlo}\label{itm:gap-planning}
\end{enumerate}

In this paper, we reflect on these gaps and their technical implications on the overall development experience of creating \ac{BDI} agents that interact with Web resources and how this can be mitigated through the design of agent-oriented programming languages and frameworks. 

We start by providing a brief overview of the \ac{BDI} model, the hypermedia nature of the (Semantic) Web and the fundamental principles of \ac{hMAS} in \Cref{sec:background}.
%
We then analyze the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia in \Cref{sec:integrating-bdi-hypermedia}.
%
In doing so,
we identify ideal integration requirements and let those guide our analysis of existing approaches that have attempted to bridge the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia in the past to understand limitations and potential room for improvement.
%
Finally, in \Cref{sec:generalized-bdi-engine} we present our research direction
aiming to tighten the integration of \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia
and reduce the abstraction gap for developers 
by introducing a generalized \ac{BDI} engine
that can directly leverage Semantic Web technologies for belief representation and reasoning processes.
%
We show preliminary results of a proof-of-concept implementation
and discuss open challenges and opportunities of this approach.

\sbnote{Related works, JASDL (Jason+Ontological reasoning), Yggdrasil framework, Hypermedea (Saint-Etienne Cartago Artifacts for Hypermedia), others.... }

\paragraph{Semantic extensions of AgentSpeak}
In \cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05} authors propose an AgentSpeak extension named AgentSpeak-DL, 
where the belief base concepts are extended with the addition of \ac{DL}.
%
With the \ac{DL} extension, 
AgentSpeak-DL supports the definition of more structured objects and relationships between them, 
rather than only logic terms.
%
The semantics of AgentSpeak-DL demonstrates that agent-oriented programming can be extended for the development of Semantic Web applications, 
easing their adaptation to applications such as Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing.
%
In line with the requirements in~\Cref{subsec:integration-requirements}, 
authors highlight that changing the belief representation affects three operations of the whole AgentSpeak lifecycle, namely: the plan research, the query on the Belief Base, and the Belief Update.

\paragraph{Integration of DL in BDI engines}
The semantic extension AgentSpeak-DL proposed in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05}, 
is set to ground in JASDL~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08}.
%
In this work, 
authors provide an extension of \jason{} \ac{BDI} engine, 
where core elements are customised to welcome \ac{DL} semantics.
%
The latter is represented as a ``semantically-enriched'' literal,
represented inside the agent's belief base using FOL notation.
%
This choice allow to use \jason{}'s standard belief base selection mechanisms, 
and adds on top of them a reasoning engine that query the ontology instance.
%
The choice to represent \ac{DL} in this way in the engine has the advantage that make use of fullfledged \jason{} engine features.
%
However, 
this hindered the direct integration of the operational semantics described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08} 
and required technological workarounds to integrate it.
\mbnote{I know that ``workaround'' is not a good way to say this, I will improve the form}
