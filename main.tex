\section{Introduction}
%==========================================================

Integrating intelligent agents with the Web is a long-standing goal
in both the \ac{MAS}~\cite{DBLP:conf/edoc/ShafiqDF06}
and Semantic Web~\cite{lassila2001semantic} communities, but,
despite such common interest, 
the famous question ``Where are all the intelligent agents?'' remains unanswered to this day~\cite{hendlerb2007expert}.

In the last decade, developments in the engineering of Web services including
the more pervasive use of hypermedia and the \ac{REST} architectural style~\missingref[fielding]{},
and the growing adoption of Web interoperability standards even outside the traditional Web domain
-- such as the \ac{WoT}~\missingref[wotarch]{} --
has renewed the interest in the integration of \ac{MAS} and the Web.
%
In this context, 
the proposal of \ac{hMAS}~\missingref[ciortea]{} suggested a new perspective
envisioning the Web itself as an open environment
which agents can roam by consuming and manipulating hypermedia resources.
%
As an outcome of the resurgence of Web \ac{MAS},
the \ac{W3C} Autonomous Agents on the Web community group\footnote{\url{https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/}}
has been founded to connect researchers and practitioners working in the area. 

Even more recently, the advent of \ac{LLM} and the \emph{Agentic AI} movement~\cite{acharya2025access} 
have taken by storm the development of intelligent agents that interact with the Web by invoking Web APIs~\missingref{} and interpreting natural language content~\missingref{}.
%
Despite these approaches showing promising results,
they do not yet replace the controllability of traditional agent-programming paradigms~\missingref{},
nor they make obsolete the need for structured knowledge representation and reasoning provided by Semantic Web technologies~\cite{pan2024tkde}.
%
Agents developed with cognitive architectures such as the \ac{BDI} model
capable of leveraging structured knowledge within the Semantic Web 
hence remain a valid approach for the development of intelligent systems on the Web.

We argue that the integration of \ac{BDI} agents with the Web
is hindered by a conceptual and technological gap, 
which limits developers in creating agents that can effectively reason and operate on semantic hypermedia resources.
Namely:
\begin{enumerate}[label={\roman*)}]
  \item \ac{BDI} agents have typically been tied to logic programming with \ac{FOL} and unification -- e.g., with the popular \agentspeak{} semantic~\missingref[agentspeak]{} --
  whereas the Semantic Web is grounded on \ac{DL} and the mechanism of inference through the \ac{OWL} and \ac{RDF};
  \label{itm:gap-logic}
  \item \ac{BDI} agents are typically implemented with the \ac{PRS} architecture~\missingref{} which relies on pre-defined plans and hence provides limited support for the exploitation of new action possibilities discovered in an open hypermedia environment.\sbsidenote{Decidiamo se sto secondo punto lo esploriamo per completezza o se vogliamo cavarlo}\label{itm:gap-planning}
\end{enumerate}

In this paper, we reflect on these gaps and their technical implications on the overall development experience of creating \ac{BDI} agents that interact with Web resources and how this can be mitigated through the design of agent-oriented programming languages and frameworks. 

We start by providing a brief overview of the \ac{BDI} model, the hypermedia nature of the (Semantic) Web and the fundamental principles of \ac{hMAS} in \Cref{sec:background}.
%
We then analyze the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia in \Cref{sec:integrating-bdi-hypermedia}.
%
In doing so,
we identify ideal integration requirements and let those guide our analysis of existing approaches that have attempted to bridge the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia in the past to understand limitations and potential room for improvement.
%
Finally, in \Cref{sec:generalized-bdi-engine} we present our research direction
aiming to tighten the integration of \ac{BDI} agents and hypermedia
and reduce the abstraction gap for developers 
by introducing a generalized \ac{BDI} engine
that can directly leverage Semantic Web technologies for belief representation and reasoning processes.
%
We show preliminary results of a proof-of-concept implementation
and discuss open challenges and opportunities of this approach.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
%==========================================================

\subsection{BDI Agents}

\sbnote{Add BDI agents background, e.g. BDI architecture, BDI logic, etc. talk about agentspeak, jason, PRS}
The \ac{BDI} model~\missingref[bdimodel]{}
is a well-established cognitive architecture for the development of intelligent agents.
%
It is based on the idea of representing an agent's mental state in terms of three key components:
\begin{inlinelist}
  \item \emph{beliefs} represent what the agent thinks to be true about the world,
  \item \emph{desires} represent the potential goals or objectives an agent may pursue,
  \item \emph{intentions} represent the agent's commitments to achieve specific desires.
\end{inlinelist}
%
Practically, most \ac{BDI} agents implementations follow the \ac{PRS} architecture~\missingref[prs]{},
which is based on the ability for agents to select \emph{plans} from a predefined set
and execute them to achieve their intentions.

Arguably, the most popular implementation of the \ac{BDI} model is \agentspeak{}~\missingref[agentspeak]{}:
a logic-based agent programming language that provides a formal syntax and semantics for representing beliefs, desires, and intentions using logic predicates.
\agentspeak{} agents leverage the syntactical expressiveness of logic programming to concisely and declaratively define beliefs and goals, and exploit logic unification to query the agent's \emph{belief base} and match plans to achieve their goals.
This operational semantic has been reified in several concrete languages~\missingref{} the \jason{}~\missingref[jason]{} agent programming platform, which provides an \agentspeak{} interpreter and a Java-based runtime environment for implementing \ac{BDI} \ac{MAS}.

\label{sec:integrating-bdi-hypermedia}
%==========================================================

\subsection{Gap Analysis}

From the brief background presented in \Cref{sec:background}, 
it should be evident that
despite the both \ac{BDI} agents and the Semantic Web being rooted in logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning,
there are significant differences between the two worlds.

Although \ac{FOL}, typically used in \ac{BDI} agents is theoretically expressive enough to represent the same knowledge as \ac{DL}~\missingref{} 
-- as the latter is a subset of the former --
when it comes to practical applications this creates an abstraction and technological gap
which can be difficult to bridge for developers.

\paragraph{Syntactical Differences}

On a syntactical level, \ac{BDI} agents represent beliefs and goals using logic formulas which are either atomic \emph{terms} (e.g., \textsf{alice}) or a \emph{structure} composed of a \emph{functor} followed by an arbitrary number of \emph{arguments} within parentheses (e.g. \textsf{person(alice)}).
%
Differently, the Semantic Web relies on \ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL} to represent knowledge in the form of \emph{triples} which connect a \emph{subject} to an \emph{object} through a \emph{predicate} (e.g. \textsf{:alice rdf:type foaf:Person}).
%
Although triples can be mapped to logic formulas maintaining the same semantics, from a practical point of view, the degrees of freedom provided by \ac{FOL} in this mapping can lead to a variety of seemingly ``semantically equivalent'' syntactical representations (e.g., \textsf{type(alice, person)} and \textsf{triple(alice, type, person)} are reasonable mappings of the \ac{RDF} triple above).
%
Developers wishing to integrate \ac{BDI} agents with the Semantic Web hence face the challenges of choosing a suitable -- and more importantly consistent -- mapping which we believe adds a significant cognitive load during the development process.

\paragraph{Semantics and Reasoning}
Differently from \ac{FOL} where the semantics of a formula within the set of facts of the logic theory itself, 
\ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL} provides a set of \emph{axioms} that define the meaning of the triples and how they can be inferred (e.g., \textsf{rdf:type} is a predicate that specify an \emph{instance of} relationship between the subject and a class).
%
When using \emph{ontologies} to represent standardized knowledge (e.g., \textsf{foaf}\footnote{\url{http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/}} in the example above), 
the semantics of the triples is further defined by the ontology itself,
which can include additional axioms, constraints, and relationships between concepts.
%
This means that, in order to properly reason about the knowledge represented in \ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL},
developers may need to translate the whole \ac{RDF}, \ac{OWL} and ontology semantics into their own belief base, adding a significant overhead and a potential source of inconsistencies.

\subsection{Integration Requirements}
\label{subsec:integration-requirements}

Guided by the analysis of the gap between \ac{BDI} agents and semantic representation of hypermedia resources,
we identify a set of requirements that we believe may level such gap for practical development of \ac{BDI} agents in Web environments.
We hence propose that a \ac{BDI} agent programming framework for \ac{hMAS} should support the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item direct manipulation of \ac{RDF} and \ac{OWL} triples in the agent's belief base;
  \item support for ontological reasoning and inference for reasoning and plan selection;
  \item support for querying the belief base using \ac{SPARQL} instead of logic unification;
  \item ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Existing Approaches}
\sbnote{Related works, JASDL (Jason+Ontological reasoning), Yggdrasil framework, Hypermedea (Saint-Etienne Cartago Artifacts for Hypermedia), others.... }

\paragraph{Semantic extensions of AgentSpeak}
In \cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05} authors propose an AgentSpeak extension named AgentSpeak-DL, 
where the belief base concepts are extended with the addition of \ac{DL}.
%
With the \ac{DL} extension, 
AgentSpeak-DL supports the definition of more structured objects and relationships between them, 
rather than only logic terms.
%
The semantics of AgentSpeak-DL demonstrates that agent-oriented programming can be extended for the development of Semantic Web applications, 
easing their adaptation to applications such as Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing.
%
In line with the requirements in~\Cref{subsec:integration-requirements}, 
authors highlight that changing the belief representation affects three operations of the whole AgentSpeak lifecycle, namely: the plan research, the query on the Belief Base, and the Belief Update.

\paragraph{Integration of DL in BDI engines}
The semantic extension AgentSpeak-DL proposed in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05}, 
is set to ground in JASDL~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08}.
%
In this work, 
authors provide an extension of \jason{} \ac{BDI} engine, 
where core elements are customised to welcome \ac{DL} semantics.
%
The latter is represented as a ``semantically-enriched'' literal,
represented inside the agent's belief base using FOL notation.
%
This choice allow to use \jason{}'s standard belief base selection mechanisms, 
and adds on top of them a reasoning engine that query the ontology instance.
%
The choice to represent \ac{DL} in this way in the engine has the advantage that make use of fullfledged \jason{} engine features.
%
However, 
this hindered the direct integration of the operational semantics described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08} 
and required technological workarounds to integrate it.
\mbnote{I know that ``workaround'' is not a good way to say this, I will improve the form}
