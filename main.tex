%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Traditional BDI agents, 
  rooted in logic programming, 
  remain poorly integrated with the hypermedia nature of open Web environments
  which typically rely on Semantic Web technologies such as RDF and OWL.
  This paper examines the abstraction gap between these paradigms and surveys existing integration efforts on a conceptual and technical level.
  Our proposal for a deeper integration relies on a generalized BDI engine to enable the development of BDI agents that can directly reason and operate on hypermedia resources.
  We reflect on the potential benefits and challenges of this approach and show preliminary results of a proof-of-concept implementation.

\paragraph{Semantic extensions of AgentSpeak}
In \cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05} authors propose an AgentSpeak extension named AgentSpeak-DL, 
where the belief base concepts are extended with the addition of \ac{DL}.
%
With the \ac{DL} extension, 
AgentSpeak-DL supports the definition of more structured objects and relationships between them, 
rather than only logic terms.
%
The semantics of AgentSpeak-DL demonstrates that agent-oriented programming can be extended for the development of Semantic Web applications, 
easing their adaptation to applications such as Grid Computing and Ubiquitous Computing.
%
In line with the requirements in~\Cref{subsec:integration-requirements}, 
authors highlight that changing the belief representation affects three operations of the whole AgentSpeak lifecycle, namely: the plan research, the query on the Belief Base, and the Belief Update.

\paragraph{Integration of DL in BDI engines}
The semantic extension AgentSpeak-DL proposed in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/MoreiraVBH05}, 
is set to ground in JASDL~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08}.
%
In this work, 
authors provide an extension of \jason{} \ac{BDI} engine, 
where core elements are customised to welcome \ac{DL} semantics.
%
The latter is represented as a ``semantically-enriched'' literal,
represented inside the agent's belief base using FOL notation.
%
This choice allow to use \jason{}'s standard belief base selection mechanisms, 
and adds on top of them a reasoning engine that query the ontology instance.
%
The choice to represent \ac{DL} in this way in the engine has the advantage that make use of fullfledged \jason{} engine features.
%
However, 
this hindered the direct integration of the operational semantics described in~\cite{DBLP:conf/dalt/KlapiscakB08} 
and required technological workarounds to integrate it.
\mbnote{I know that ``workaround'' is not a good way to say this, I will improve the form}
